Excel Inventory & Sales Management System

## Project Overview
 
 This project is an Excel-based Inventory and Sales Management System developed to track stock movement, monitor daily transactions, and maintain accurate inventory records for garment business operations.
 
 The system is designed to automate stock calculations, reduce manual errors, and support monthly reconciliation processes through structured data linking and automated formulas.

 ## Project Purpose
 
 The purpose of this project is to create a reliable and efficient system that helps businesses:
 
 Track daily inventory movement
 
 Monitor stock availability
 
 Record production and returns
 
 Maintain operational accuracy
 
 Support reconciliation and reporting
 
 This system reflects real-world garment inventory workflow used in business operations.

## ⭐ Key Features

✔ Daily Product Tracking (1 – 31 Day Monitoring)
✔ Opening & Closing Stock Balance Management
✔ RTO (Return to Origin / Old Stock Adjustment Tracking)
✔ DTO (Delivery / Sales Tracking System)
✔ Master Goods Production Monitoring
✔ Category-wise Inventory Calculation
✔ Automated Grand Total Calculation
✔ Linked Multi-Sheet Inventory Flow
✔ Monthly Stock Reconciliation Support

## ⚙️ System Workflow

The system follows a structured inventory lifecycle:

1️⃣ Opening Balance Sheet

Records starting monthly stock
Acts as base stock for calculations

2️⃣ RTO & Old Stock Sheet

Tracks returned or adjusted inventory
Updates available stock

3️⃣ DTO Tracking Sheet

Records daily outgoing product sales or dispatch
Tracks date-wise transaction flow

4️⃣ Master Goods Sheet

Records production or stock addition
Updates total available inventory

5️⃣ Final Stock Calculation
Stock is calculated using automated formulas:

Present Stock = Opening Stock + Production + Returns − Sales

## 📁 Sheet Explanation

📊 Opening Balance

Contains monthly starting inventory data.

🔄 RTO & Old Stock

Tracks returned goods and old stock adjustments.

🚚 DTO Tracking

Records daily product dispatch and sales quantities.

🏭 Master Goods

Tracks production or new stock entries.

## 📈 Summary & Category Tracking

Calculates totals, category-wise stock distribution, and final balances.

🧠 Business Logic Implemented

## 🔐 Privacy & Data Disclaimer

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:

This repository contains a demonstration version created using simulated and limited sample data to maintain business confidentiality.

The original system designed and implemented by me supports multi-firm inventory integration under a centralized parent company structure, including extended reconciliation, reporting, and operational tracking functionalities.

No real company data has been used in this project.
